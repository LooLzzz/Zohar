# Lysis Curves

This repo present graphs for an assay in microbiology, which follows the lytic cycle activation of bacteriophages at SOS conditions.  
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect and kill bacteria.

The main reason for this repo's existence is to take the raw data from a lab experiment, in the form of a `.csv` file, process it and turn it into a human readable graph.
